# android_bruteForce
This code aims to bruteforce the pin of android lockscreen with all possible combinations of 0-9
specifically, using a 4-length pin brute.

The code below is an incomplete code. Thus, I need the help of developers to help 
take the  'try again in 30 seconds' off and also to help stop the program when the correct pin
is found.

And thanks to the developer whose python code I copied from Stackoverflow. Much respect. Thanks
